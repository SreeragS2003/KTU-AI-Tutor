    <github-md>Searching for Solutions in Artificial Intelligence

This section explores various search techniques used in AI to find solutions to problems.  We've already seen techniques like local search and adversarial search.  The objective of every problem-solving technique is to find a solution to reach a goal.  However, unlike constraint satisfaction (discussed later), these methods don't inherently incorporate constraints on the agents during problem-solving.

**Atomic Representations:**  Many search algorithms operate using atomic representations.  In an atomic representation, each state of the world is indivisible—it has no internal structure.  Consider finding a driving route across a country. We might reduce the state of the world to simply the name of the current city—a single atom of knowledge, a "black box" whose only discernible property is its difference from other cities.  The algorithms underlying search and game-playing, Hidden Markov Models, and Markov Decision Processes all work with atomic representations.

**Constraint Satisfaction Problems:**  Another problem-solving technique is Constraint Satisfaction.  This involves solving a problem under certain constraints or rules.  A problem is solved when its values satisfy these constraints.  This technique provides a deeper understanding of problem structure and complexity.  Constraint satisfaction depends on three components:

*   **X:** A set of variables.
*   **D:** A set of domains where the variables reside (each variable has a specific domain).
*   **C:** A set of constraints followed by the set of variables.

In constraint satisfaction, domains are the spaces where variables reside, following problem-specific constraints.  These are the three main elements.
