    <github-md>Informed Search Strategies: A* Search

Informed search strategies are those that use knowledge about the problem domain to guide the search process, making them more efficient than uninformed search strategies.  One important informed search strategy is A* search.  The provided text does not offer a detailed explanation of A* search; however, it does mention A* search as one of the informed search strategies covered in the course module on problem-solving agents.  Therefore, a complete explanation of A* search would need to be supplemented from external resources.  The notes do mention other informed search strategies like Best-First search.  Further, the notes describe problem-solving agents and their use of atomic representations,  which are relevant to the context of search algorithms, but do not directly explain A* search.
