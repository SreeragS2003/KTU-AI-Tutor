    <github-md>**Informed Search Strategies: Best-First Search**

Best-first search is an informed search strategy that combines aspects of both depth-first and breadth-first search.  It uses a heuristic function to guide the search, selecting the path that appears most promising at each step.  This allows it to leverage the advantages of both depth-first and breadth-first search.

**How Best-First Search Works:**

At each iteration, best-first search expands the node that is estimated to be closest to the goal node. This closeness is estimated using a heuristic function, denoted as *h(n)*, which estimates the cost of an optimal path from node *n* to the goal.  The best-first search algorithm uses the heuristic function to select the node with the lowest estimated cost.  In this context, the evaluation function is f(n) = h(n).

**Best-First Search Algorithm:**

1. Place the starting node into the OPEN list.
2. If the OPEN list is empty, stop and return failure.
3. Remove the node *n* from the OPEN list which has the lowest value of *h(n)*, and place it in the CLOSED list.
4. Expand node *n*, and generate its successors.
5. Check each successor of node *n* to determine if any is a goal node. If a successor node is a goal node, return success and terminate the search. Otherwise, continue.


**Implementation:**

The greedy best-first algorithm is typically implemented using a priority queue to efficiently manage the OPEN list, allowing for quick retrieval of the node with the lowest heuristic value.  The algorithm continues until a goal state is found or the OPEN list is exhausted.
