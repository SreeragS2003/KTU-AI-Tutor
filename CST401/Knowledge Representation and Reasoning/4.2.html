    <github-md>**Propositional Logic**

The mathematical development of propositional logic, also known as Boolean logic, significantly advanced the field of Artificial Intelligence.  Its origins can be traced back to the work of George Boole (1815-1864), who detailed the principles of this system (Boole, 1847).  Propositional logic deals with propositions, which are statements that can be either true or false.  These propositions are combined using logical connectives such as AND, OR, and NOT to form more complex expressions.  The formal rules of propositional logic allow for the derivation of valid conclusions from given premises.  This system provides a foundation for reasoning with certainty, a crucial aspect of AI systems.  Gottlob Frege (1848-1925) extended Boole's work to include objects and relations, creating first-order logic, a more expressive system used in modern AI.  Alfred Tarski (1902-1983) further contributed by developing a theory of reference that connects the objects within a logical system to real-world objects.  The ability to manipulate statements of logical certainty is a key tool provided by mathematicians to the field of AI.
