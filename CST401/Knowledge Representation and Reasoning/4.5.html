    <github-md>**First-Order Predicate Logic – Syntax and Semantics**

First-order logic (FOL), also known as predicate logic or first-order predicate logic, is an extension of propositional logic used in artificial intelligence for knowledge representation.  Unlike propositional logic, which can only represent facts as true or false, FOL can represent complex sentences and natural language statements.  It's more expressive, allowing representation of statements like "Some humans are intelligent" or "Sachin likes cricket," which are impossible to represent using only propositional logic.

FOL assumes the world contains:

*   **Objects:**  A, B, people, numbers, colors, wars, theories, squares, pits, wumpus, etc.
*   **Relations:** These can be unary (e.g., red, round, is adjacent) or n-ary (e.g., sister of, brother of, has color, comes between).
*   **Functions:**  Father of, best friend, third inning of, end of, etc.

Like natural language, FOL has two main parts:

*   **Syntax:**  The rules for forming well-formed formulas (WFFs).  (Specific syntax rules are not detailed in the provided text.)
*   **Semantics:** The rules for interpreting the meaning of WFFs. (Specific semantic rules are not detailed in the provided text.)

The provided text mentions that first-order logic was initially developed by extending Boole's propositional logic. Gottlob Frege extended Boole's work to include objects and relations, creating the first-order logic used today.  Alfred Tarski contributed a theory of reference, showing how to relate objects within the logic to objects in the real world.  The text also states that  FOL is "another way of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence," and that it can express relationships between objects.  However, the provided text does not give a detailed explanation of the syntax and semantics of FOL.
