    <github-md>**Logical Agents – Knowledge-Based Agents and Logic**

This section explores logical agents, a type of knowledge-based agent that uses logic to represent knowledge and reason about the world.  We will examine how logical formalisms are used to build intelligent systems.

**Foundations in Logic and Mathematics:**

The development of AI as a formal science required mathematical formalization in three key areas: logic, computation, and probability.  The idea of formal logic traces back to ancient Greece, with significant mathematical development starting with George Boole's work on propositional (Boolean) logic (Boole, 1847). Gottlob Frege extended this to first-order logic (1879), which is widely used today. Alfred Tarski's theory of reference (1902-1983) demonstrated how to link logical objects to real-world objects.  Probability theory, particularly Bayes' rule (Thomas Bayes, 1702-1761), provides a framework for reasoning under uncertainty, crucial for many AI applications.

**Knowledge Representation:**

Logical agents represent knowledge using logical sentences.  The provided text mentions different levels of representation complexity:

*   **Atomic representation:**  Each state is indivisible, lacking internal structure.  An example is representing a city in a route-finding problem simply by its name.  Algorithms like those used in search, game-playing, Hidden Markov Models, and Markov Decision Processes often use this approach.
*   **Factored and Structured representations:**  These offer more expressive power, allowing for more detailed modeling of the world's state.  (Further details on these are not provided in the given text).

**Reasoning and Inference:**

Logical agents use inference to derive new knowledge from existing knowledge.  Aristotle's syllogisms provide an early example of a formal system for generating conclusions mechanically from premises.  The text also notes the importance of understanding how to draw valid conclusions using formal rules.

**Philosophical Underpinnings:**

Philosophical ideas have significantly influenced AI.  Key concepts include:

*   **Rationalism:** The power of reasoning in understanding the world.
*   **Dualism:** The belief in a non-physical aspect of the mind separate from the physical brain.
*   **Materialism:** The view that the mind is entirely a product of the physical brain's operation according to the laws of physics.
*   **Logical positivism:** The doctrine that all knowledge can be reduced to logical theories connected to observable sensory inputs.
*   **Induction:** The process of acquiring general rules from repeated associations.
*   **Confirmation theory:**  The study of how knowledge is acquired from experience.


**Agent Architecture:**

The text describes the components of a learning agent:

*   **Performance element:**  The part of the agent that selects actions.
*   **Learning element:** Modifies the performance element based on feedback.
*   **Critic:** Provides feedback on the agent's performance relative to a standard.
*   **Problem generator:** Suggests actions leading to informative experiences.

The agent's architecture includes sensors and actuators, and the agent program maps percepts to actions. A table-driven approach can be used to implement a rational agent by creating a table mapping percept sequences to actions.  However, this quickly becomes impractical for complex environments.
