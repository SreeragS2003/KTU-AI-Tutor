    <github-md>Propositional Theorem Proving

The mathematical development of formal logic, crucial to AI, began with George Boole (1815-1864), who detailed propositional, or Boolean, logic.  This forms the foundation for propositional theorem proving.  Gottlob Frege (1848-1925) extended this to include objects and relations, creating first-order logic, a more powerful system but still building upon the base of propositional logic.  Alfred Tarski (1902-1983) further contributed with a theory of reference, showing how to connect logical objects to real-world objects.  These advancements in logic provide the tools to manipulate statements of logical certainty, a key component of AI systems.  Early work in AI, such as the "Logic Theorist" program created by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon in 1955, demonstrated the application of logic to prove mathematical theorems, showcasing the power of propositional theorem proving in AI.  The Logic Theorist program proved 38 of 52 mathematics theorems and even found new and more elegant proofs for some theorems.  The ability to generate conclusions mechanically from initial premises, as suggested by Aristotle's system of syllogisms, is a central concept in propositional theorem proving.  This mechanical generation of conclusions is a core element of automated reasoning systems which are used in AI.
