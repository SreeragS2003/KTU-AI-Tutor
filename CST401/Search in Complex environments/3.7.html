    <github-md>## The Structure of Problems in Artificial Intelligence

This section explores different ways to represent and structure problems within the field of Artificial Intelligence.  The complexity and expressive power of these representations can be placed along an axis: atomic, factored, and structured.

**Atomic Representation:**

In an atomic representation, each state of the world is indivisible; it has no internal structure.  As an example, consider finding a driving route across a country.  The state of the world could be reduced to simply the name of the current city – a single "atom" of knowledge, a "black box" distinguishable only by its difference from other such boxes.  Algorithms like those underlying search, game-playing, Hidden Markov Models, and Markov Decision Processes often utilize atomic representations.

**Problem Solving Techniques and Constraints:**

We've examined various problem-solving techniques such as local search and adversarial search.  While these methods don't explicitly incorporate constraints, another approach, *Constraint Satisfaction*, directly addresses problems with inherent rules or limitations.

Constraint satisfaction involves solving a problem where values must satisfy specific constraints or rules. This approach provides deeper understanding of the problem's structure and complexity.  It depends on three core components:

*   **X:** A set of variables.
*   **D:** A set of domains where the variables reside (each variable has a specific domain).
*   **C:** A set of constraints followed by the variables.

In constraint satisfaction, domains define the spaces where variables exist, adhering to problem-specific constraints.  These three elements are fundamental to the technique.
