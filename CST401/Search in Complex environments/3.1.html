    <github-md>**Adversarial Search - Games**

Adversarial search examines problems where planning must account for other agents actively working against you.  Unlike single-agent search strategies focusing on finding a solution through a sequence of actions, adversarial search involves multiple agents competing within the same search space—a common scenario in game playing.  This multi-agent environment pits each agent against others, requiring each to consider opponents' actions and their impact on its own performance.

Adversarial searches, often called games, are characterized by two or more players with conflicting goals exploring the same search space.  Games are modeled using a search problem and a heuristic evaluation function; these are key to modeling and solving games in AI.

**Types of Games in AI:**

Games are categorized based on the presence of deterministic or chance moves and perfect or imperfect information:

* **Deterministic, Perfect Information:**  Chess, Checkers, Go, Othello.  In these games, agents have complete knowledge of the game state (the "board") and can see each other's moves.

* **Deterministic, Imperfect Information:** Battleships, Blind Man's Bluff, Tic-Tac-Toe. Here, agents lack complete information about the game state.

* **Chance Moves, Perfect Information:** Backgammon, Monopoly.  These games involve elements of chance (e.g., dice rolls) in addition to players' actions, but the state of the game is still fully observable.

* **Chance Moves, Imperfect Information:** Bridge, Poker, Scrabble, Nuclear War.  These games combine both chance and incomplete information.


**Perfect Information:**  A game with perfect information allows agents to see the complete game board and all previous moves.

**Imperfect Information:**  A game with imperfect information means agents don't have all the information, and are unaware of everything that's happening.
