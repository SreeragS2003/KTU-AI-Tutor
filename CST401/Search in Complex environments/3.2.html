    <github-md>**Optimal Decisions in Games: The Minimax Algorithm**

The Minimax algorithm is a recursive or backtracking algorithm used in decision-making and game theory.  It provides an optimal move for a player, assuming the opponent is also playing optimally.  The algorithm searches through the game tree using recursion. It's primarily used for two-player games like Chess, Checkers, tic-tac-toe, and Go.

**How Minimax Works:**

Two players participate: MAX and MIN.  MAX aims to maximize its payoff, while MIN aims to minimize MAX's payoff.  MAX selects the maximized value, and MIN selects the minimized value.  The algorithm performs a depth-first search to explore the complete game tree, proceeding to the terminal nodes before backtracking.

**Pseudo-code for MinMax Algorithm:**

```
function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer) is   
  if depth == 0 or node is a terminal node then   
    return static evaluation of node   
```

**(Note: The provided text cuts off the pseudocode before its completion.)**

**Types of Games:**

*   **Deterministic games:** These follow strict rules and patterns with no randomness. Examples include chess, checkers, Go, and tic-tac-toe.
*   **Non-deterministic games:** These involve unpredictable events and elements of chance or luck (e.g., dice or cards).  Each action's response isn't fixed. Also known as stochastic games. Examples include Backgammon, Monopoly, and Poker.


**Properties of the Minimax Algorithm:**

*   **Complete:**  It finds a solution (if one exists) in a finite search tree.
*   **Optimal:** It's optimal if both opponents play optimally.
*   **Time Complexity:** O(b<sup>m</sup>), where 'b' is the branching factor of the game tree, and 'm' is the maximum depth.  (This is due to the depth-first search.)
*   **Space Complexity:** O(b<sup>m</sup>), similar to depth-first search.


**Limitations of the Minimax Algorithm:**

The main drawback is its slow speed for complex games like Chess and Go, which have enormous branching factors.
