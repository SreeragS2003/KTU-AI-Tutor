    <github-md>**Constraint Satisfaction Problems – Defining CSP**

Constraint satisfaction is a problem-solving technique where a problem is solved when its values satisfy certain constraints or rules.  This technique leads to a deeper understanding of the problem structure and its complexity.

A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) depends on three components:

*   **X:** A set of variables.
*   **D:** A set of domains where the variables reside. Each variable has a specific domain.
*   **C:** A set of constraints followed by the set of variables.

In constraint satisfaction, domains are the spaces where the variables reside, following problem-specific constraints.  The constraint value consists of a pair of {scope, rel}. The scope is a tuple of variables participating in the constraint, and rel is a relation including a list of values the variables can take to satisfy the problem's constraints.

**Solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems**

To solve a CSP, we need:

*   A state-space
*   The notion of a solution

A state in the state-space is defined by assigning values to some or all variables, such as {X1=v1, X2=v2, and so on…}.

Variable value assignments can be:

*   **Consistent or Legal Assignment:** An assignment that does not violate any constraint or rule.
*   **Complete Assignment:** An assignment where every variable is assigned a value, and the solution to the CSP remains consistent.
*   **Partial Assignment:** An assignment that assigns values to only some of the variables.

**Types of Domains in CSP**

CSPs utilize two types of domains:

*   **Discrete Domain:** An infinite domain that can have one state for multiple variables.  For example, a start state can be allocated infinitely many times for each variable.
*   **Finite Domain:** A finite domain with continuous states, describing one domain for one specific variable.  It's also called a continuous domain.

**Constraint Types in CSP**

Regarding variables, there are:

*   **Unary Constraints:** The simplest type, restricting the value of a single variable.
*   **Binary Constraints:** Constraints relating two variables.  For example, a value x2 will contain a value which lies between x1 and x3.
