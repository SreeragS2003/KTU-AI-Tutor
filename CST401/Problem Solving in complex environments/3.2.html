    <github-md>**Optimal Decisions in Games: The Minimax Algorithm**

The Minimax algorithm is a recursive or backtracking algorithm used in decision-making and game theory.  It provides an optimal move for a player, assuming the opponent is also playing optimally.  The algorithm searches through the game tree using recursion.  It's commonly used in two-player games like Chess, Checkers, tic-tac-toe, and Go.

**How Minimax Works:**

Two players participate: MAX and MIN.  MAX aims to maximize its payoff, while MIN aims to minimize MAX's payoff.  MAX selects the maximized value, and MIN selects the minimized value. The algorithm performs a depth-first search of the game tree, exploring all the way to terminal nodes before backtracking.

**Pseudo-code for MinMax Algorithm:**

```
function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer) is   
  if depth == 0 or node is a terminal node then   
    return static evaluation of node   
```

**(Note: The provided text cuts off the pseudocode before it is complete.)**

**Types of Games:**

* **Deterministic games:** These follow strict rules and patterns, with no randomness. Examples include chess, checkers, Go, and tic-tac-toe.
* **Non-deterministic games:** These incorporate unpredictable events and chance elements (dice, cards).  Examples include backgammon, Monopoly, and poker.  These are also called stochastic games.

**Properties of the Minimax Algorithm:**

* **Complete:**  It finds a solution (if one exists) in a finite search tree.
* **Optimal:** It's optimal if both opponents play optimally.
* **Time Complexity:** O(bm), where 'b' is the branching factor and 'm' is the maximum depth of the game tree (due to its depth-first search nature).
* **Space Complexity:** O(bm), similar to depth-first search.

**Limitations of the Minimax Algorithm:**

The main drawback is its slow performance for complex games like chess and Go, which have enormous branching factors.
