**1.2 The Foundations of AI**

The Foundations of AI provide a brief history of the disciplines contributing ideas, viewpoints, and techniques to the field.  Different people conceptualize AI differently. Two key questions are: Are we concerned with thinking or behavior? Do we want to model humans or work from an ideal standard?  Intelligence is primarily concerned with rational action; ideally, an intelligent agent takes the best possible action in any situation.  We will study building agents intelligent in this sense.

Philosophers (dating back to 400 BC) made AI conceivable by proposing that the mind is machine-like, operates on knowledge encoded in an internal language, and that thought is used to choose actions. Mathematicians provided tools to manipulate statements of logical certainty and uncertain, probabilistic statements. They also laid the groundwork for understanding computation and reasoning about algorithms. Economists formalized decision-making to maximize expected outcomes.

Induction: general rules are acquired through repeated associations between elements. Logical positivism: the doctrine that all knowledge is characterized by logical theories connected to observation sentences corresponding to sensory inputs; thus, it combines rationalism and empiricism. Confirmation theory attempts to analyze knowledge acquisition from experience.

**Mathematics**

Key questions addressed by mathematics include: What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions? What can be computed? How do we reason with uncertain information?  Philosophers established fundamental AI ideas, but a formal science required mathematical formalization in logic, computation, and probability.  George Boole (1815–1864) developed propositional or Boolean logic. Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) extended this to include objects and relations, creating first-order logic. Alfred Tarski (1902–1983) introduced a theory of reference relating logic objects to real-world objects.  Thomas Bayes (1702–1761) proposed a rule for updating probabilities based on new evidence, underlying most modern approaches to uncertain reasoning in AI.

**Economics**

Key questions addressed by economics include: How should we make decisions to maximize payoff? How should we do this when others may not cooperate? How should we do this when the payoff is far in the future?

**Psychology**

Psychologists adopted the idea that humans and animals are information-processing machines.  Linguists showed that language use fits this model. Computer engineers provided the artifacts enabling AI applications. AI programs are often large and rely on advances in computer speed and memory. Control theory deals with designing devices that act optimally based on environmental feedback; while initially distinct from AI, these fields are converging.

**Philosophy**

Key questions addressed by philosophy include: Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions? How does the mind arise from a physical brain? Where does knowledge come from? How does knowledge lead to action?  Aristotle (384–322 BC) formulated laws governing the rational mind and developed a system of syllogisms for reasoning. Thomas Hobbes (1651) suggested the idea of an “artificial animal.”  Important philosophical terms include rationalism (reasoning's power in understanding the world), dualism (a part of the mind is outside of nature), and materialism (the brain operates according to physical laws).


**1.2 History of AI**

Artificial Intelligence is not a new concept or technology.  Even ancient Greek and Egyptian myths feature mechanical men.

**Maturation of Artificial Intelligence (1943-1952)**

* **1943:** Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts proposed a model of artificial neurons.
* **1949:** Donald Hebb demonstrated a rule for modifying connection strength between neurons (Hebbian learning).
* **1950:** Alan Turing published "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," proposing a test (the Turing test) to check a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to human intelligence.

**The Birth of Artificial Intelligence (1952-1956)**

* **1955:** Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon created the "Logic Theorist," an AI program that proved 38 of 52 mathematics theorems.
* **1956:** John McCarthy coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" at the Dartmouth Conference, establishing AI as an academic field.  High-level computer languages like FORTRAN, LISP, and COBOL were invented around this time.

Ktesibios of Alexandria (c. 250 BC) built a self-controlling water clock, changing the definition of what an artifact could do.  In 1957, B.F. Skinner published *Verbal Behavior*, a behaviorist approach to language learning, showing the intersection of modern linguistics and AI in computational linguistics or natural language processing.
