    <github-md>**Good Behavior: The Concept of Rationality**

The definitions on the left measure success in terms of fidelity to human performance, whereas the ones on the right measure against an ideal performance measure, which is called rationality.  A system is rational if it does the “right thing,” given what it knows.  Intelligence is concerned mainly with rational action. Ideally, an intelligent agent takes the best possible action in a situation. We will study the problem of building agents that are intelligent in this sense.  Economists formalized the problem of making decisions that maximize the expected outcome to the decision-maker.
