    <github-md>**1.1 Introduction - What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?**

Artificial intelligence is a broad branch of computer science focused on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks usually requiring human intelligence.  AI enables machines to mimic human cognitive abilities.  AI is increasingly integrated into daily life, from self-driving cars to virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa.

AI can be described in several ways:

*   [Definitions from provided text, but image is omitted]  The definitions on top are concerned with thought processes and reasoning, whereas the ones on the bottom address behavior. The definitions on the left measure success in terms of fidelity to human performance, whereas the ones on the right measure against an ideal performance measure, called rationality. A system is rational if it does the “right thing,” given what it knows.


Acting humanly: The Turing Test approach

The Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing (1950), aims to provide a practical definition of intelligence. A judge communicates with a human and a machine via text. Both try to behave like a human; the judge attempts to identify which is which.  A computer passes if the judge cannot distinguish between the human and the machine responses.  This requires capabilities in:

*   Natural Language Processing
*   Knowledge Representation
*   Automated Reasoning
*   Machine Learning

The total Turing Test extends this to include video and physical interaction, requiring computer vision and robotics.  These six disciplines largely constitute AI.

Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach

To determine if a program thinks like a human, we need to understand how humans think.  This involves examining the actual processes of the human mind.
